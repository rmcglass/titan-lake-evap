## Seasonal changes in evaporation rates on Titan

The Cassini-Hugyens mission confirmed the presence of stable bodies of liquid hydrocarbons on the surface of Titan. Like on Earth, these lakes may interact with the atmosphere and play a significant role in a methane cycle analogous to Earth’s hydrologic cycle. These air-sea interactions have been previously modeled (Mitri et al., 2007; Rafkin & Soto, 2020; Tokano, 2013), to confirm the significance of these interactions. In addition, GCMs suggest seasonal temperature changes of up to 4K at the poles, which is where the bulk of Titan’s lakes are located (Mitri et al., 2007). Previous evaporation models have assumed a constant molar fraction of liquid methane, although it is known that this is dependent on the temperature. Here, I model the evaporation rate over a full Titan year (29.5 Earth years). This is based off of the methods used in Tokano (2013), but I introduce a temperature dependent molar fraction of liquid methane, which I get from the surface liquid model developed by Tan et al. (2013). I find that with this new temperature dependent molar fraction of methane, the evaporation rate is highest during Titan’s winter and zero during Titan’s summer.
